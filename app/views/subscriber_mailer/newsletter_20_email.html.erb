    Hey there,
  </p>

  <p class="pb-2">
    You're receiving this email because you signed up for the Balkan Ruby
    newsletter or purchased a ticket. I'm Genadi, the organizer, and I'm
    excited to announce that <b>Balkan Ruby 2026</b> is happening on May 15–16
    in Sofia, Bulgaria!
  </p>

  <h2 class="pb-2">
    Balkan Ruby is about the HOT TAKES
  </h2>

  <p class="pb-2">
    This year, we're creating <strong>a safe space for unconventional opinions</strong>.
    We want to hear your honest perspectives on Ruby, Rails, and the tech world – even
    (especially) when they challenge the mainstream narrative.
  </p>

  <h2 class="pb-2">
    Our CFP is OPEN
  </h2>

  <p class="pb-2">
    Our hot take is that the speaking application process <strong>HAS
    TOO MANY NAMES</strong>. Call for speakers, call for proposals, call for applications,
    call for papers... Whatever you call it, it's open! We're looking for speakers
    to bring fresh perspectives and new (unconventional (or well-forgotten)) takes.
    <%= link_to "Submit your talk proposal", "https://balkanruby.com/apply", class: "link-primary" %>
    (see) and join us at the <b>National Museum "Earth and Man"</b> – a beautiful venue
    housing over 20,000 minerals, including actual rubies and other gemstones!
  </p>

  <h2 class="pb-2">
    A few tickets a day keep the (need of) sponsors away 🎶
  </h2>

  <p class="pb-2">
    Early bird tickets are now available! <%= link_to "Grab your ticket", checkouts_url, class: "link-primary" %>
    and secure your spot for May 15–16, 2026 in Sofia.
  </p>

    Or, win a free ticket!
  </h2>

  <p class="pb-2">
    We're running a competition: <strong>share your hottest tech hot take for a chance
    to win a free Balkan Ruby 2026 ticket</strong>! Whether it's about frameworks,
