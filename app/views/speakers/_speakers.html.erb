      Balkan Ruby is a technical event by heart but its also a small business.
      As we are rebuilding it for 2024, we want to talk about it!
    </p>
    <p>
      We are developers first and love tech, so we are looking for <b>technical
      talks</b> about solving critical business problems, and <b>business
      talks</b> on how to run our (or a) enterprise we live off of. We don’t
      aspire to turn developers into entrepreneurs or vice-versa, we won't be
      wearing suits and we'll still be cussing our asses off, but we want to
      bring understanding about the business realities that are facing us, as
      developers, and what it takes to make those brave ideas into a functioning
      reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to show a lot of business perspectives as well – as Ruby
      developers, we can work at (or run) a service company, a consultancy, a product
      company, and more – we can make money out of side gigs, OSS work, selling
      developer tools, podcasts, events and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2025 we'll be back with another theme, but for 2024 – it's all about
      business!
    </p>
