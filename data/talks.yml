  about: >
    <p>
      Building an useful OSS project is a lot of work. Maintaining a successful
      project over an extended period of time is a ton of work. Most of it is
      neither appreciated, nor paid for. Often maintainers have to deal with
      unreasonable expectations and hostility towards their projects and them by
      association. A lot of maintainers quickly lose their motivation or burn out
      in the process. Good projects get abandoned to rot. Is there a way out? Can
      we do things better?
    </p>
    <p>
      In this talk we'll cover some of the main challenges for OSS projects:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Setting up good processes around a project</li>
      <li>Marketing your work</li>
      <li>Building a community</li>
      <li>Raising funding</li>
      <li>Work/life balance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We'll approach the topic from the perspective of a project maintainer,
      but we believe that everyone will learn something useful, regardless of
      their level of involvement with OSS projects.

  about: >
    <p>
      You've heard the whispers, sensed the hype, but you're still not sure what
      all the fuss is about with SQLite these days. Join me as we explore the
      use-cases and benefits of running SQLite in a production environment. Along
      the way, we will learn why SQLite makes sense as your next production
      database and how to ensure that your setup is optimized for end-user
      performance and developer happiness. We will setup and deploy a vanilla
      Rails application to demonstrate both how easy that process can be and how
      solid the performance is out-of-the-box. We will then explore some of the
      more advanced features of SQLite and how to use them to your advantage.
      Finally, we will discuss some of the common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
      You will leave this talk with a solid understanding of how to get started
      with SQLite in production and how to ensure that your application is
      running at peak performance. Come along for the ride!

      For the last four years, we have been using Ruby/Rails as the core of our
      tech stack, and it has taken us through a global pandemic, a few funding
      rounds and even a pivot. As CTO, I've been lucky to have a first-row seat
      in this journey and would love to share what we have learned about the
      industry and using Ruby on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruby and almost indissolubly Rails have had for a very long time the
      reputation of being a slow, too-unpredictable language and, as a
      consequence, frown upon industries that prime performance and security.
      Although some of the heaviest hitters in the world of transacting money
      -Stripe, Shopify- depend on Ruby, we still get sceptical looks from time
      to time when we describe our stack.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, in our daily practice, we have not only not found the language a
      source of problems but have come to appreciate it as a source of joy,
      especially the devs that have come in contact with Ruby for the first time
      when incorporated in Devengo. Nonetheless, there are some tough challenges to
      overcome when building a scalable service in one of the most tightly
      regulated and demanding spaces – Finance.
