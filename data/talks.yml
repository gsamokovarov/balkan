    <p>
      Building an useful OSS project is a lot of work. Maintaining a successful
      project over an extended period of time is a ton of work. Most of it is
      neither appreciated, nor paid for. Often maintainers have to deal with
      unreasonable expectations and hostility towards their projects and them by
      association. A lot of maintainers quickly lose their motivation or burn out
      in the process. Good projects get abandoned to rot. Is there a way out? Can
      we do things better?
    </p>
    <p>
      In this talk we'll cover some of the main challenges for OSS projects:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Setting up good processes around a project</li>
      <li>Marketing your work</li>
      <li>Building a community</li>
      <li>Raising funding</li>
      <li>Work/life balance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We'll approach the topic from the perspective of a project maintainer,
      but we believe that everyone will learn something useful, regardless of
      their level of involvement with OSS projects.

      product consulting company that has been around for over 17 years
      now–bootstrapping, adjusting to changing reality, being a part of the Ruby

  about: >
    <p>
      You've heard the whispers, sensed the hype, but you're still not sure what
      all the fuss is about with SQLite these days. Join me as we explore the
      use-cases and benefits of running SQLite in a production environment. Along
      the way, we will learn why SQLite makes sense as your next production
      database and how to ensure that your setup is optimized for end-user
      performance and developer happiness. We will setup and deploy a vanilla
      Rails application to demonstrate both how easy that process can be and how
      solid the performance is out-of-the-box. We will then explore some of the
      more advanced features of SQLite and how to use them to your advantage.
      Finally, we will discuss some of the common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
      You will leave this talk with a solid understanding of how to get started
      with SQLite in production and how to ensure that your application is
      running at peak performance. Come along for the ride!
