    Honeybadger combines ALL the monitoring! Error monitoring, uptime
    monitoring, cron and heartbeat monitoring, performance monitoring, plus
    status pages into a single easy-to-use platform. It’s everything you need
    to keep production healthy and your customers happy.

    Best of all, Honeybadger installs with two lines of code so you can
    simplify your stack, lower your bills, and speed up your workflow in as
    little as five minutes. Too good to be true?
